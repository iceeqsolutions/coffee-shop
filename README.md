## About

The Coffee Shop is a React/TypeScript demo project using Redux in the background, which allows for easier access to global state variables, making it ideal e.g. in web shop projects.

In this demo we've used a simple API with only a handful of products, which therefore didn't require any API key. However, even with this limited amound of data, it's possible to play around with Redux and get a feel for it and its power.

All of this could be taken a step further by adding a database connection. In this simple demo, however, no such connection is available. Instead, clicking the Checkout button only clears the shopping cart content an re-routes the user to the home page.

For styling, we used Tailwind that allows for higher flexibility than e.g. Bootstrap. You can find some custom configurations in the tailwind.config.ts file, which we set up for this demo.
